"""clogging.py - a collection of logging support methods for use at the US Census Bureau.

This module adds support for logging to syslog to the Python logging system. 

All messages sent to the default logger will also go to syslog. We use
this in some production environments to aggregate log messages using
syslog and Splunk.

In the 2020 Disclosure Avoidance System, we will be using local1 as our logging facility. 
Within Amazon's Elastic Map Reduce system, we set up the EMR CORE nodes to send all local1 messages
to the MASTER node, and we set up the MASTER node to send all local1 messages to the Splunk server.

This code also sets up the Python logger so that it reports the
filename, line number, and function name associated with all log
messages. That's proven to be useful. You can change that by changing
the module variables after the module is imported.

To use this logging module, you must call clogging.setup().  The call
must be called in every Python process in which you want logging to go
to syslog. In an EMR system, this means that you need to call it at
least once in every mapper (because a new Python process may be
started up at any time by the Spark system). Calling clogging.setup()
is fast and idempotent---you can call it as often as you want. It
tracks to see if it has been previously called and immediately returns
if it has been.

This code has been tested on both Apple MAC OSX and on Amazon Linux.
